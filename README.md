## 🔧 Setup Instructions

- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/eeshalteluri/karl-spa.git
```

### Environment Variables


To run this project, you will need to add `.env` files. One in client directory, and other in server directory.

### Frontend (client)
- Go to the `client` folder
- Create a `.env` file inside the client folder, and add:
`VITE_BACKEND_URL` variable

`VITE_BACKEND_URL`= `http://localhost:5005` (for development)

`VITE_BACKEND_URL`= `<your-backend-url>` (for production)

### Backend (server)
- Go to the `server` folder
- Create a `.env` file inside the server folder, and add:
`URI`, `PORT`, `FRONTEND_URL` variables.

`URI`=`<your-mongodb-connection-uri>`

`PORT`=`5005`

`FRONTEND_URL` = `http://localhost:5173` (for development)

`FRONTEND_URL` = `<your-backend-url>` (for production)

### Installing Dependencies

- Start both client and server in separate terminals.

#### for Client(Frontend)

```bash
  cd client
  npm install
```
#### for Server(Backend)

```bash
  cd server
  npm install

- This application assumes CORS is enabled on the backend to allow requests from the frontend.

- Ensure MongoDB service is running or accessible (e.g., via MongoDB Atlas).

- If using HTTPS or deploying to production, make sure to update the environment variables accordingly.
