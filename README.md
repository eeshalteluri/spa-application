### Environment Variables


To run this project, you will need to add `.env` files. One in client directory, and other in server directory.

### Frontend (client)
- Go to the `client` folder
- Create a `.env` file inside the client folder, and add:
`VITE_BACKEND_URL` variable

`VITE_BACKEND_URL`= `http://localhost:5005` (for development)

`VITE_BACKEND_URL`= `<your-backend-url>` (for production)

### Backend (server)
- Go to the `server` folder
- Create a `.env` file inside the server folder, and add:
`URI`, `PORT`, `FRONTEND_URL` variables.

`URI`=`<your-mongodb-connection-uri>`

`PORT`=`5005`

`FRONTEND_URL` = `http://localhost:5173` (for development)

`FRONTEND_URL` = `<your-backend-url>` (for production)
